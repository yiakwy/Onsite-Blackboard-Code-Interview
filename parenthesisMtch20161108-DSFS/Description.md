Parenthesis Printing
====================

Given a sequence of open or close parathesis signs, print maximum matches in the order they appear or delete unmatched parathesis signs.

e.g:

1. in: ((())())
    out: ((())())

2. in: ((())()
    out: (())()

> In the second example, you can interpretatee it as :
> **?(())()**
> where '?' should be deleted
