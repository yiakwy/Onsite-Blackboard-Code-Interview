#### No.1 Title: given bidirectional edges, with start point and end point, find the shortest path from the start to end. \(yiak.wy@gmail.com\)

###### Input:

```
A - B
A - C
A - D
B - C
B - E
E - F
F - A 
F - B
```

###### Expected Output:

With above input, we expect a shortest path from A - E:

###### Your job:

Your are required to write codes to parsing input and print computed output onto console for testing.

#### No.2 Linear Scanning Algorithm.

It is important to locate a point within non-convex geometry. Try to implement an algorithm to verify wether a point inside or outside an arbitrary geometry.

#### No.x Other problems
