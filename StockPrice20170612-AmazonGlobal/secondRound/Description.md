Many people including ones who are very experienced don't understand OOP style for computer science very well. Their vision is limited in Java or C++ style, a trap designed by others implicitly. However, ObjectiveC and Go demonstrate that, pure C is just enought for a OOP style programming. The codes is far reaching than speech. Let 's see all this could be done very easily using pure C.

Another problem is, even though "topk" is very popular among interviewees, some of interviewers don't understand it well and potentially brought some troubles to testees.

Hence I will demonstrate the codes both in Mini heap or Max heap for "Top k Largest elements". This is also a latest onsite question both from Microsoft Azure and Amazon Inventroy Healthy global teams.

If you don't understand it well. Leave names and message on the pod, I will reach you soon.
