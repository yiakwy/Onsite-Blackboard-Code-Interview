Max Val Compute
===============

Given a series of data, for example [6 2 1], choose maximum computed value vover sub interval. The v is equal to that mimum of the value times the length of the sub interval.

[6 2 1]: 1 \* (6+2+1) = 9
[6 2]: 2 \* (6+2) = 16
[6]: 6 \* 6 = 36
...

we find 36 is the maximum valume.
